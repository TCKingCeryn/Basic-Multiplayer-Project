# Test Mirror Multiplayer Project
A collaborative test project with a simple Mirror Multiplayer game.  Built to test a potential workflow with remote artists and programmers.

Includes basic Room setup, i.e. "Waiting for Players," as well as direct Host/Client connection.  Right now limited to Local IPV4 machine for testing.
