# Multiplayer Unity FullBody FPS Controller

A test project for a Unity Multiplayer game with Mirror networking.  Built to test a potential workflow with remote artists and programmers.
Includes a basic Waiting Room setup, as well as direct Host/Client connection.  Currently limited to Local IPV4 address for testing.

Built on my Free Open-Source FullBody FPS Controller, found here:
